ðŸ“Œ GitHub Clarifications

on the github when we have a folder or files listed in .gitignore some files it wont be uploaded to github 
that is why when you clone you have to run  npm install.
 

to pull the data on main brunch you have to make this :

git pull origin main --rebase 
when they say that you have staged chages that mean that you have made some changes but not pushed to github

# Udacity-JS

This repository is a collection of my **JavaScript learning journey** from Udacity,Google,other sources and my own practice examples.  
It contains notes, small projects, and code snippets that I use to understand and apply JavaScript concepts.  

---

## 🎯 Purpose
- Document everything I study about **JavaScript**  
- Practice concepts by writing my **own examples**  
- Run and test code using **Node.js**  
- Build a reference repo that I can look back on  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** – Main language of practice  
- **Node.js** – To run and test code in the terminal  

---
## 📂 Repo Structure
Here’s what each file covers:  
- `arrays.js` → Working with arrays  
- `callback.js` → Callbacks basics  
- `cond.js` → Conditionals (`if`, `else`, `switch`)  
- `functions.js` → Functions and return values  
- `hoisted.js` → Hoisting concepts  
- `loops.js` → `for`, `while`, `do-while` loops  
- `looponarrays.js` → Looping through arrays  
- `methods.js` / `objectmethods.js` → Using methods in JavaScript  
- `numbers.js` → Number operations and math  
- `expression.js`, `inline.js`, `realWorld.js`, etc. → Practice snippets and real-world examples  

---

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Add small projects that apply these concepts (e.g., calculator, to-do list, quiz app).  
- Continue refining this repo as my **JavaScript reference library**.

## 📌 Note
This repo is **not a finished project**, but rather my **learning workspace**.  
I’m sharing it to track my growth and hopefully help others starting their JavaScript journey.
